#                   **Word Processor**
### Video Demo:  <https://share.vidyard.com/watch/hYFrPdmrgwoi2aiQMWNfSw?>
#### Description: This project is what you think it is and what you think it does.
##### It is a word processor that can change text fonts and colors and can do other types of word manipulation.
##### You can save the file to your computer in whatever local directory you would like.
##### It is a project I wanted to do just to see if I could do it.
##### I haven't worked too long with C# and this project helps catapult my knowledge.
##### This app uses radio buttons.
##### It also uses textboxes.
##### It uses a Menu Strip with several fuctionalities.
##### The About tab under help is more of a goofy statement than anything else.
##### And just to see if anyone actually reads these things, I have decided to put a login page on it.
##### The process of the login page was to see if I could do it.
##### The credentials are words login credentials that an instructor used to use years ago
##### They are hard coded in a seperate form page.
##### This brings me to the next thing: there was made using four forms.
##### The first one is the login form that does what I explained above.
##### The second form is the word processor itself.
##### The third one is the encryption button in the Toolbar Strip located and labeled as a picture.
##### The last one is the decryption button that is also in the Toolbar Strip located and labeled as a picture.
##### Also located in the toolbar strip is the undo, redo, save (which will be greyed out until the file is saved by pressing save as), new file, open, font, font color, cut, paste, clipboard, and exit icons.


### **The Details of the Word Processing App**
##### The credentials are username: Grace password: Hopper.
##### Once you log in, you can begin typing whatever you would like.
##### After you finish typing, you can highlight the text and change the colors.
##### You can also change the font size.
##### Change the shape of the text.
##### Highlight certain paragraphs, words or texts.
##### You can then save the file as a text file.
##### By default it will save as an rtf (rich text) file.
##### By default the save option will not work until you have first used the save as option.
##### You can create a new file by clicking on the icon or using the menu strip.
##### To do this you would go to the top and click on file and look for the New File tab.
##### There is an exit tab to quickly exit the app.
##### You can undo or redo actions.
##### You can copy text or cut them.
##### You can paste whatever text is saved in the clipboard.
##### The App could definitely use some work, but this is the first big project I've ever done with C#.
##### Enjoy.
